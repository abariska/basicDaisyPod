**Disclaimer:**
I'm not a professional programmer and this repo is just a result of my first experience and fun with Daisy Pod. 
There's no guarantee that everything works exactly as needed, but, if you also just starting with Daisy Pod it's great opportunity to see some easy solutions and reproduce them by yourself.
Have fun and welcome to audio-programming world!

**!!! To be able to use libDaisy and DaisySP libraries, the folder [DaisyExamples](https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisyExamples) must be located two levels up from the project folder!!!**
